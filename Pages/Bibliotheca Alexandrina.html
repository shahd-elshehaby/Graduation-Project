                        The Ancient Library of Alexandria<br>
                        The Ancient Library of Alexandria, established over 2,000 years ago by the successors of Alexander the Great, was one of the most renowned centers of knowledge in the ancient world. Founded by Ptolemy I Soter and later expanded by Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 BCE), it housed up to 700,000 scrolls, including works by Homer, Aristotle, and other great thinkers. The library was not just a repository of books but also a research institution, attracting scholars like Euclid, Archimedes, and Eratosthenes, who calculated the Earth's circumference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The library consisted of two main sections: the "Mouseion," a research institution where scholars lived and worked, and the library itself, which stored scrolls. It was divided into two locations: the main library near the Mouseion and a smaller one in the Serapeum temple. Ptolemy II played a key role in its development, sending expeditions to collect books from across the world and preserving Greek literary classics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The library's decline began during the Roman era, with a mysterious fire in 48 BCE during Julius Caesar's invasion. Although Mark Antony gifted Cleopatra 200,000 scrolls from Pergamum as compensation, the library gradually fell into disrepair due to political and religious conflicts. By 400 CE, the library had vanished, but its legacy as a symbol of knowledge and learning endured.

                    <p>
                        The Revival: Bibliotheca Alexandrina
                        In the late 20th century, the idea of reviving the Library of Alexandria gained momentum. With UNESCO's support, the Egyptian government launched the project, and the new Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002. Designed by the Norwegian firm Snøhetta, the library features a striking circular design with four underground levels and six above-ground floors. It houses millions of books, including rare manuscripts, and serves as a cultural and scientific hub.

                        <br>The library includes specialized sections for arts, multimedia, children, and the visually impaired, as well as four museums, a planetarium, and 15 permanent exhibitions. It also hosts academic research centers and international institutions, fostering dialogue and understanding across cultures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Digital Initiatives<br>
                        The Bibliotheca Alexandrina is a pioneer in digital knowledge sharing. It collaborates with the Library of Congress on the World Digital Library, which provides free access to rare manuscripts, maps, and other cultural artifacts. Additionally, the Million Books Project aims to digitize a million books, including 75,000 in Arabic, making knowledge accessible to millions worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cultural and Scientific Contributions
                        <br>The Bibliotheca Alexandrina is not just a library but a cultural complex. It includes:

                        <br>Six specialized libraries: For arts, multimedia, children, youth, the visually impaired, and rare books.

                        <br>Four museums: Antiquities, Manuscripts, Sadat, and the History of Science.

                        <br>A planetarium and an exploratorium: To engage children and the public in science and astronomy.

                        <br>Fifteen permanent exhibitions: Showcasing Alexandria's history, Arabic calligraphy, and contemporary Egyptian art.

                        <br>Eight academic research centers: Focusing on Mediterranean studies, arts, manuscripts, and digital humanities.

                        <br>The library also hosts international conferences, cultural events, and exhibitions, making it a vibrant hub for intellectual and artistic exchange.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Global Partnerships<br>
                        The Bibliotheca Alexandrina has established partnerships with leading global institutions, including UNESCO, the Library of Congress, and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). It is also a member of the World Digital Library consortium, which aims to digitize and share cultural heritage from around the world.
                    </p>
