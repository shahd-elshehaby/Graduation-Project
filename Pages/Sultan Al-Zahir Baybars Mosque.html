                    <p>The Mosque of Sultan Al-Zahir Baybars is one of the most prominent historical and religious landmarks in Egypt, and it is considered one of the oldest and most important mosques from the Mamluk era. Its construction began under Sultan Al-Zahir Baybars al-Bunduqdari (658–676 AH / 1260–1277 AD) in 665 AH (1266 AD), covering an area of approximately three feddans (12,600 square meters). It was inaugurated for prayer in Shawwal 667 AH (1268 AD) and remained active for about 550 years before undergoing a long period of closure lasting around 225 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>Design of the Mosque:
                    <br>The mosque consists of a central courtyard surrounded by four iwans (arcades), with the largest being the qibla iwan. Above the area preceding the mihrab stood a large dome built in the style of the tomb of Imam Al-Shafi'i, though it eventually collapsed over time. The mosque has three main entrances, each adorned with an inscription documenting its foundation and significance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Historical Events and Changes Over Time:
                    <br>Throughout history, the mosque witnessed numerous transformations due to significant events. During the French campaign in Egypt (1798–1801 AD), it was converted into a military fortress, where the French used its walls as fortifications and turned its minaret into a watchtower until it collapsed. In 1812, some of the mosque's columns were removed and transferred to Al-Azhar Mosque to construct the Sharqawiyya arcade for students from the eastern region.
                    </p>
                    <p>Under British occupation, the mosque was repurposed as a storage facility for war supplies and later as a slaughterhouse until 1915, causing extensive damage to its structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>Restoration Efforts:
                    <br>In 1918, the Committee for the Preservation of Arab Antiquities initiated restoration work, focusing on repairing the qibla iwan and other damaged parts of the mosque. Later, the Supreme Council of Antiquities collaborated with Kazakhstan on a comprehensive restoration project that began in 2007 and concluded in phases, with final completion in 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p>The restoration included reinforcing architectural and artistic elements, repairing wooden ceilings, strengthening foundations and structural components, and regulating groundwater levels to prevent further deterioration. The external trench was restored, and marble and stone floors were installed in the courtyard and arcades. Additionally, during the restoration process, an ancient cistern was discovered beneath the mosque's courtyard, highlighting the sophisticated engineering of its original design.
                    </p>
                    <p>Significance of the Mosque:
                    <br>The Mosque of Al-Zahir Baybars stands as a symbol of power and grandeur from the Mamluk era, showcasing the remarkable skill of architects and engineers who worked under Sultan Baybars. Today, it remains an important place of worship and a key site for studying Islamic architecture. It is the third-largest historical mosque in Egypt and one of Cairo’s most significant historic landmarks.
                    </p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the Mosque of Sultan Al-Zahir Baybars is not only a religious monument but also an open museum that tells the story of Islamic civilization in Egypt. Despite the challenges it faced over centuries, it has been revitalized through dedicated preservation and restoration efforts, ensuring its legacy endures for future generations.
