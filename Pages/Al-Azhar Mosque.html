                    <p>Al-Azhar Mosque (359-361 AH / 970-975 AD) is one of the most prominent historical and religious landmarks in the Islamic world. It is not merely a mosque but an ancient university established over a thousand years ago. Al-Azhar is considered the first mosque built in Cairo and the oldest surviving Fatimid monument in Egypt. Since its foundation, it has remained a symbol of Islamic knowledge and thought, serving as a central hub for spreading Islamic teachings.</p>

                    <p>The Founding of Al-Azhar:
                    Al-Azhar was established by the Fatimids during the conquest of Egypt by the commander "Jawhar al-Siqilli," who founded the city of Cairo under the orders of the Fatimid Caliph "Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah." Construction began in 359 AH / 970 AD and was completed in 361 AH / 972 AD, with the first Friday prayer held on 7 Ramadan 361 AH. Initially built to propagate the Ismaili Shiite doctrine, Al-Azhar became a center for Sunni education after the fall of the Fatimid dynasty.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Origin of Its Name:
                    The mosque is named "Al-Azhar" in honor of "Fatimah al-Zahra," the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad ï·º, as a symbol of reverence and respect for her legacy. While historians differ on the exact origin of the name, this explanation is the most widely accepted.
                    </p>
                    <p>Al-Azhar Through the Ages:</p>
                    
                    <p>The Fatimid Era:
                    Initially, Al-Azhar served as a center for spreading Shiite thought, teaching Ismaili jurisprudence and religious sciences. Over time, it evolved into a broader institution for Islamic learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Mamluk Era:
                    The Mamluk period marked a golden age for Al-Azhar. The Mamluks expanded the mosque, added facilities, and supported scholars and students, making it a leading center of Islamic scholarship. Sunni teachings, Arabic language, jurisprudence, hadith, and tafsir were emphasized.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Ottoman Era:
                    Despite initial tensions, the Ottomans respected Al-Azhar, though they provided limited financial support. During this period, Al-Azhar became a primary center for Islamic studies in Egypt and began teaching philosophical and logical sciences.
                    </p>
                    <p>The French Campaign:
                    During the French campaign in Egypt (1798-1801), Al-Azhar became a center of resistance against French occupation. Its scholars led the first and second Cairo uprisings, enduring severe repression. Despite these challenges, Al-Azhar maintained its role as a beacon of knowledge and resistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Muhammad Ali Era:
                    After the French withdrawal, Muhammad Ali Pasha strengthened ties with Al-Azhar, providing financial and moral support. His successors continued this tradition, enhancing Al-Azhar's status as a religious and educational institution.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Modern Era:
                    In 1961, Al-Azhar was officially declared a university, expanding to include faculties of medicine, engineering, and pharmacy alongside traditional disciplines like Sharia and law. It became a comprehensive institution blending religious and scientific education.
                    </p>
                    <p>Prominent Scholars of Al-Azhar:
                    Throughout its history, Al-Azhar has produced numerous renowned scholars, including:
                    </p>
                    <p>Ibn Khaldun: Founder of sociology.
                    Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani: A leading hadith scholar.
                    Al-Sakhawi: Historian and hadith expert.
                    Ibn Taghribirdi: Historian and writer.
                    Al-Qalqashandi: Author of "Subh al-A'sha."
                    Al-Azhar's Importance in the Islamic World:
                    Al-Azhar is one of the most significant religious and educational centers in the Islamic world. It plays a pivotal role in promoting moderate Islam and enjoys a special status among Muslims globally. Today, it hosts thousands of students from various Islamic and non-Islamic countries, symbolizing Islamic unity and international cooperation.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Current State of Al-Azhar:
                    To this day, Al-Azhar stands tall, defying time with its towering minarets and distinguished scholars. It advocates for truth, peace, and coexistence among nations. Al-Azhar remains a vital voice against extremism and terrorism, continuing its mission to nurture generations with the values of tolerant Islam.
                    </p>
                    <p>In Conclusion:
                    Al-Azhar is not just a mosque or a university; it is a symbol of Islamic and Arab history, a cradle of knowledge, and a testament to the enduring legacy of Islamic civilization. It will remain steadfast as long as its walls and minarets stand.
