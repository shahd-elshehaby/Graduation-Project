                    <p>The Egyptian pyramids, especially those of Giza, are among the greatest architectural wonders in the ancient world and represent an extraordinary cultural heritage showcasing the engineering and artistic brilliance of the ancient Egyptians. Located on the Giza Plateau west of Cairo, these monuments include three main pyramids: Khufu’s Pyramid , Khafre’s Pyramid , and Menkaure’s Pyramid , as well as the famous Sphinx , which symbolizes strength and wisdom.</p>

                    <p>The Three Pyramids:<br>
                        Khufu’s Pyramid (The Great Pyramid):<br>
                        The Great Pyramid of Khufu is the largest and most renowned of all the Egyptian pyramids. Built during the reign of King Khufu from the Fourth Dynasty around 2580 BCE, its original height was approximately 146.6 meters , making it the tallest man-made structure for nearly 3800 years. However, due to erosion and weather conditions, its current height has decreased to about 138.75 meters .
                        Khafre’s Pyramid:<br>
                        The second-largest pyramid at Giza is Khafre’s Pyramid , built by Khufu’s son between 2520 and 2494 BCE. Although smaller than Khufu’s Pyramid, its current height is approximately 136.4 meters . Despite being shorter, it appears taller due to its slightly elevated position on the plateau.
                        Menkaure’s Pyramid:<br>
                        The smallest of the three pyramids is Menkaure’s Pyramid , constructed by King Menkaure, the son of Khafre and grandson of Khufu. It stands at a current height of approximately 62 meters , with each side of its base measuring around 108.5 meters . This pyramid differs from the others in its use of granite for the lower part of the structure and limestone for the upper sections.</p>
                    <p>King Menkaure's Pyramid Complex
                        In addition to the pyramid itself, King Menkaure’s Pyramid Complex includes the Valley Temple, the Mortuary Temple, and three smaller pyramids dedicated to the queens.
                        
                        Valley Temple:<br>
                        The Valley Temple was an essential part of the complex, serving as a place for religious rituals related to the king and his journey to the afterlife.
                        Smaller Pyramids:<br>
                        To the south of Menkaure’s Pyramid, there are three smaller pyramids believed to have been built for the queens, including Queen Khentkaus II , one of Menkaure’s wives.
                        Burial Chamber:<br>
                        Inside the pyramid, archaeologists discovered a granite sarcophagus inscribed with the king’s name, though it was lost during transportation across the sea.</p>
                    <p>The Sphinx<br>
                        Located near the entrance to the Giza Pyramids, the Sphinx is one of the most famous landmarks in the world. This statue depicts a mythical creature with a human head and a lion’s body in a reclining position, facing directly eastward.
                        
                        Dimensions:<br>
                        The Sphinx measures approximately 73 meters long and 20 meters high , making it one of the largest statues globally.
                        Symbolism:<br>
                        In ancient Egyptian culture, the Sphinx symbolizes strength and wisdom. During the Eighteenth Dynasty (circa 1550–1295 BCE), it was considered a sacred guardian protecting the land against evil forces from the desert.</p>
                    
                    <p>The pyramids and the Sphinx are not just tourist attractions but are also powerful symbols of the greatness of ancient Egyptian civilization. The pyramids were royal tombs symbolizing the concept of life after death, while the Sphinx represents strength, wisdom, and protection. These monuments reflect the remarkable advancements made by ancient Egypt in engineering, art, and administrative organization.

                        Sound and Light Shows

                        <br>The sound and light show dramatizes the stories of the three pyramids—Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure—as well as the Great Sphinx, which is considered one of the oldest colossal sculptures in the world.

                        <br>Our show addresses all the rumors surrounding the reason for the broken nose of the Sphinx, explaining how it came to have its current appearance, and reveals the secrets behind the construction of these massive structures, which have long intrigued scientists seeking to uncover the mysteries of their creation.
